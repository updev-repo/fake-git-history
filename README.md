# Fake Git History
A Python script to generate a fake Git repository history with random commit messages and commit dates. Script is in basic version, to show how to easily make looks your github like you commit a lot, in case of dumb recruitments requirements

# Usage
 When prompted, choose between two options:

Create a single commit on a specific date
Create multiple commits between two dates
If you choose to create a single commit, you will be prompted to enter the date in the format YYYY/MM/DD. The script will then create a random number of commits on that day, each with a random commit message.

If you choose to create multiple commits, you will be prompted to enter the start and stop dates in the format YYYY/MM/DD. The script will then create a random number of commits (between 45 and 113) on each day between the start and stop dates, with random commit messages.

If using range commits please keep in mind that pushing range greater than 10/15 might results in no effect on GitHub.

## You should adjust these variables 
```
        self.min_commits = 45
        self.max_commits = 113
        self.remote_url = "https://github.com/theveloper-pl/Fake-Git-History.git"
```
